My awesome mountain bike. Too bad it's blue - don't know why I keep getting blue things, when my favorite color is orange.
And too bad it's broken. I've tried to repair it but I've lost a bolt :(

> look at useless stuff
Let's see... Three PC keys (a Steuerung, an Alternativ, and an Entfernen) , a small blue shit, and a very romantic poem

Îți aduci aminte ziua când ți-am spus că ești frumoasă, 
Când, în șoaptele pădurii, poate că te-am sărutat,
Ascultând ecoul rece, înspre toamna friguroasă?

signed G. Bacovia 
Brrr.. .reminds me of Pașcanu.

> look at piece of paper
No one signed the log yet. I must be the first one to find it :)
I must have lost that bloody pen, but I'm not leaving 'till I sign.

There's a horrible creature on my bike!. I-I-I'm n-n-not touching that! Eww! Ugh!

> look at bike
It's fixed now. But it's blue!

On the bike there's a slug.

Whew! I've extended the stick at max length, but it was still a close one.

> go to Stelzenberg town center

You are in a Stelzenberg town center.
You can see the town center and a map.
You can go home or to the forest.
Ring ring! Ring ring! 
Oh! Natalie is calling! I am so late!
"Hi Natalie! I will be home in 7 minutes."

> look at town center
There are two guys sitting on the bench! That's so crowded!


> look at map
I know how to get home from here! No need to check the map... But, I'll do that, just in case. I know I'm kind of absent-minded sometimes.


> go to forest
I'm not going back already! I'm tired.

> go to home
My old school bus just passed. It always reminds me of my first year of school. I was so young!
Soon I will see the Snoopy garage. It's repainted but looks exactly as 20 years ago.

That's a strange guy in front of the garage! He wears a big cloak that also covers his head. And it's so hot outside!
The stranger approaches... It's a vampire!!!
"Hello, Adi. I've been looking for several months for someone whose blood will not give us a stomach burn. My ten brothers are awaiting at the clinic downtown, in the sample reception area."
Nice try, but I'm not stupid. I've done my research and I made sure your blood is just fine and no one can stop me.
All right, I'm only willing to let you go if you can help me find a long lost artefact. Must be around here.

You are at the Snoopy place.
You can see a vampire, a Snoopy garage and some trash cans.
You can go home.

> look at vampire
He's Lord Slug of The Vile Blood!! I shouldn't know that... Is he putting thoughts in my mind???

> speak to vampire
He says nothing.

> look at Snoopy garage
Looks so happy! I wander what it's writing. A love letter maybe?

> search Snoopy garage
I can't find anything. 

> look at trash cans
Three trash cans for different waste types. Everything is recycled in Germany! 

> search inside trash cans
I'm low on self-esteem right now, but not *that* low.

> search inside trash cans
Hmmmm... No, nothing interesting in here.

> search inside trash cans
Found an old Spell Book! Second Edition, 1274, by Angele de la Barthe.
... And a Math scroll! ... Ummm ... That's a big pile of crap! There is a mistake at line 2.

> look at Spell Book
It contains only one spell.

> look at Math scroll
There is a mistake at line 2.

> cast armageddon Spell Book
It says here I need Armageddon's Blade to make the magic happen. 

> give Math scroll to vampire
Here you go, sir!
"What is it? Let's see...", whispers the lord. "I don't think this magic will work. The second verse of the incantation is odd." 
"I'm still waiting for the right artefact. Hurry up!!!" 

> search inside trash cans
Nothing else here. 

> go to home
I have to find the artifact first. The vampire will draw blood otherwise...

> search trash cans
There's something shiny behind the middle container. Maybe I should move it so I can see better.

> move trash cans
I found the artifact! It's the Armageddon's Blade!

> search trash cans
I can't find anything.

> move trash cans
I've touched the cans enough for one day.

> give Armageddon's Blade
It does not want it.

> give Armageddon's Blade
Here you go, sir!
"Oh! You have found it!", whispers the lord. "I am deeply grateful! Not only that I will not drink your blood, but I will also give you a nice gift!" 
"This is the Vial of Slug Blood. Equipped in a Miscellaneous slot, this powerful vial puts all slugs under your command and gives you +5 Attack and +5 Defense against them. Use it wisely" 
The vampire disappears.
